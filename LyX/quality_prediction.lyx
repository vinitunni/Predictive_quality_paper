\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper, we propose a method to infer and predict the quality parameter
 of a machined part thus eliminating/reducing the need for manual quality
 measurement of the same.
 We however have not proven that the model works once we perform a tool
 change.
 We start by reading the power consumption data of the manufacturing machine.
 In this data, we look for pre-decided patterns which would correspond to
 a machining cycle and characterise each part by its corresponding pattern.
 After finding out the relevant patterns in our power consumption data we
 extract features from it and use it in a polynomial regression model to
 get a relation between these features and the quality parameter.
 After running multiple experiments, we see that the proposed method lets
 us predict the quality parameter with an error of about 1%.
 We also see that these results are quite stable and repeated when we use
 our method for different feature extraction parameters.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How is quality measured in present time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Present day quality measurements are done using various metrological tools
 which quantify various shapes and/or form features of the part.
 These features are given their individual limits by the designer which
 help a metrologist in determining whether a part that has just been manufacture
d is fit to be deemed a good part or not.
 However, most of these tools are completely external equipments which need
 to be explicitly used over the part(s) to see the results.
 This usually calls for extra man-power and reduced throughput.
 So what manufacturers end up doing is that they keep an inspection frequency
 for non critical parts where quality checks on these parts are made at
 regular intervals until one sees an anomaly.
 How this anomaly is responded to again 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem with such a way of measurement is that :-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We have to make a compromise between the throughput and inspection interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As the quality measurement is isolated from part manufacturing, you can’t
 detect a bad part unless it has already been manufactured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How do we propose to measure it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main gist of the ideology we have applied is that, when a part is being
 made, the information of each cut made by the machine is reflected in some
 real-time aspect of the machine.
 It could be noise, power, vibration, loads, etc.
 So what we do is, we record these variables (in our case, power) real-time
 using appropriate tools and find a correlation between these readings and
 the quality of the part manufactured.
 This correlation can be tightened depending on the kind of accuracy one
 is looking for.
 It also has an advantage over the conventional approach in certain key
 aspects such as:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The computational time is significantly less once a correlation model has
 been made.
 Also, buying computational time is cheaper than wasting producing time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The feedback we get is near to real time and we could infact get early warnings
 as the part is being made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kind of investment needed for this is much lesser compared to buying
 precise instruments which, other than being pretty expensive, usually have
 only a single functionality.

Getting Quality data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we need to correlate between power readings during a producing cycle
 and quality, we are essentially trying to create a model or create a procedure
 to generate a model which would take the power readings as input and give
 the quality as output.
 Thus, we needed some input quality data for a training set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this, we monitored the Ra values of a part, which underwent turning
 operation using a new tool insert, at regular intervals (once in 25 parts
 for first 500 cycles and once in every 10 parts from there on) for 1030
 parts.
 These measurements were made at two different faces and three different
 locations in each face.
 We observed a downward trend in the Ra values for the first 300 parts after
 which they were more or less constant without any particular trend (save
 for an anomalous jump at partt 500) till part 1000 after which they again
 rose up and went outside the specification limit (see Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).

So we decided to use the trend evident in the first 300 parts for our model
 creation and verification.
 We created a 2 degree polynomial fit (usig least squares approach) for
 the first three hundred parts using 12 readings as our control points.

Now this sample of 300 points was used as our quality data sample which
 would be used for creating the model and verifying the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Detect Cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For input of the model we decided to use power readings.
 We decided to go with power readings as one would expect a direct correlation
 between energy consumed and material removed.
 Also, it depends very little on parts of the machine which are not responsible
 for cutting (eg.
 housing) and thus we can make our system more flexible for various machines.
 Also, power readings can be easily obtained using conventional power meters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we plan to make an autonomous correlation model, we need to be able to
 correctly identify the start and end times of a production cycle.
 In relatively newer machines, this data can be obtained via the controller.
 However, the number of machines which are not capable of that are quite
 large.
 So we need to come up with a method to let the machine identify a cycle
 and record its start and end time.
 We use a simple pattern matching approach here.
 We are going to analyze the power readings we get as a stream of data and
 in it look for recognisable patterns which would indicate whether and where
 a cycle occurred.
 So to start, we need a known producing cycle which we can use as a template
 for comparisons.
 Once we decide this template we use an algorithm called

DTW is now used in many applications which need to compare one sequence
 to another.
 One can limit the amount of warping and thus ensure that realistic results
 are obtained.

As we can see in Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dtw fig"

\end_inset

, even if we have a time shift and small variations in data, the DTW algorithm
 maps significant features appropriately.
 This robustness is a result of the warping along time direction allowed.
 One can also limit the amount of warping permissible so that we can ensure
 that only physically possible cases are deemed similar.
 The distance between two sequences being compared is found has sum of distances
 (euclidean, manhattan, etc) between these mapped points.

\begin_layout Subsection
Extracting input from power consumption pattern
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Now we have the start and end times for 300 producing cycles and we can
 use this data to get power consumption patterns for each individual part
 and use it as necessary.
 However, we can't use these patterns directly as inputs for any machine
 learning algorithm as it has many inherent problems.
 The main reason being that small time offsets in the time series data could
 throw off the result by a large amount.
 So we basically needed to process our power pattern to extract more stable
 information from it.
 By stable, we mainly mean that we must get same information if we shift
 a cycle by a small amount (say 1 sec).
 However in the process of making it stable, we also have to make sure that
 we don’t lose the individuality of the pattern as we depend on this individual
 character for our quality reading.
 We resolved this using two methods:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scalar extractions from pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cycle splitting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scalar extractions from splitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we extract from our cycle a set of scalars which are stable and do
 not get affected due to small changes like minor time scaling, peaks,etc.
 These scalars could be mean, standard deviation, DTW distance, median,
 mode, amplitude, etc.
 However, as pointed out earlier, using these scalars alone would render
 many cycles to be same as we are wasting a lot of information.
 So we use, not one, but a combination of these scalars as now we get more
 options of variability thus giving us our desired result of stable and
 unique inputs.
 Here, we used only two of these functions:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Standard deviation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Cycle splitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a much more important process and increases the effectiveness of
 scalar extraction.
 What we essentially do cut the cycle into a number of parts using different
 methods (which will be discussed later) and apply the scalar extraction
 for each segment.
 So now we increase our number of inputs and also increase the individuality
 of each input in a stable way.
 The combination of various scalars for all splits of a cycle represent
 a particular cycle and all of them are used to get a final quality parameter
 (in our case, Ra) for each cycle.
 These 
\emph on
predicted quality metrics 
\emph default
can be compared against our 
\emph on
experimental quality metric 
\emph default
and we can get error associated with each part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much more importantly, when we later analyze our results, we can actually
 pinpoint which segments of the cycle are primarily responsible for the
 quality parameter being measured (in our case, Ra).
 This kind of information can prove to be really useful as now we can know
 what part of the cycle is primarily responsible for which quality parameter.
 This can in turn help us detecting tool damages when we observe a deviation
 in certain quality parameter.
 Splitting the cycle gives us one more important advantage.
 Now we can calculate the quality metric of a cycle by including one split
 at a time, into our input set, sequentially.
 This can be really helpful in predicting parameter qualities before the
 machining is over and thus can help us in taking corrective action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We primarily employed four different methods to split cycles.
 They were:-

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Model-Creation"

\end_inset

) to select a model.
 Then we find the RMSE of the best available solution for the test set.
 Now we split the cycle into two equal halves and again run the algorithm
 and get a new RMSE.
 If the relative drop in RMSE is higher than a threshold and the timespans
 of newly created splits is longer than a user-defined limit, we retain
 the split and move to the first half which we split and continue comparing
 and splitting it further.
 However, if the improvement is not significant enough, we move on to the
 next available section and continue till we are done with all the sections.
 It is slightly biased to create more cuts in the beginning of the cycle
 as we approach the limits of numerical accuracy of the model after the
 first few cuts (Fig

\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Let our final coefficients' set be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}_{LS}$
\end_inset

.
 Using least square method, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A_{LS}}=\arg\min_{\mathbf{A}}(\sum_{i=1}^{p}(y_{i}-\mathbf{Y_{i}})^{2})\label{eq:regul 5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which can be re-written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A_{LS}=\arg\min}(\sum_{i=1}^{p}(\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{X_{i}}-\mathbf{Y_{i}})^{2})\label{eq:regul 6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus as a result of linear regression, we finally get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y=\mathbf{A_{LS}^{T}X}\label{eq:regul 7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
when 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 are polynomial forms of each other, this is called polynomial regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when the number of variables are high, i:e, when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is large, we tend to get highly complex models with high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 which tend to overfit 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

.
 To remedy this, we include a regularization parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, such that, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A_{LS}=\arg\min}(\sum_{i=1}^{p}(\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{X_{i}}-\mathbf{Y_{i}})^{2}+\lambda\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{j}^{2})\label{eq:regul 8}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, now we can control, via 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, how complex a system we want.
 Too high a 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 gives us an overfit solution while too low a 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 gives us an underfit one.

Model Creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To implement 
\emph on
Regularised Polynomial Regression, 
\emph default
we first need to use our present variable set (which we got after extracting
 scalars from split sections of a cycle) to form polynomial variables.
 Firstly we divide our 300 cycles into two sets, a 
\emph on
training set
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
testing set
\emph default
.
 each cycle is assigned to one of these sets randomly and the ratio between
 the number of elements in the two sets can be decided by us.
 we chose a 1:1 ratio.
 Now, in the training set, for each variable (scalar from a split section),
 we have 150 other instances of the same corresponding to 150 cycles.
 This gives us a vector of that corresponding variable.This way we have a
 vector corresponding to all the variables.
 These vectors will be used to create the polynomial variables which will
 eventually be used as inputs into the 
\emph on
Regularised Linear Regression.
 
\emph default
This we do in two ways:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Orthogonal polynomials- 
\series default
We create new vectors which are orthonormal to each of the vector of variables
 we have.
 The degree of these orthogonal variables were varied to see which would
 yield reasonable results.
 We used the R function poly {stats} to find out the orthogonal polynomials
 for our purpose

\begin_layout Enumerate

Mixed polynomials-

 Here we create new vectors using the old variable vectors (denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}....,x_{n}$
\end_inset

) which can be shown asllll
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{new}(i_{1},i_{2},i_{3},.....i_{n})=\prod_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{i_{j}};\label{eq:mixed_poly_1}

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the maximum degree which we vary to get optimum results.
 As expected, we get more number of variables using this method instead
 of the orthogonal polynomials one.
 However, it helps us know if there are any meaningful interactions within
 the variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have our input vectors' set created, we just use 
\emph on
Regularised Linear Regression 
\emph default
to get a list of possible relations between our input quality.
 In the next section we discuss how we select the right parameters from
 this given list.

\begin_layout Standard
The output of the 
\emph on
regularised polynomial regression 
\emph default
is a list of solutions.
 Each solution contains a collection of coefficients which we use for a
 weighted summation of our newly calculated variable vectors.
 To compare between these various solutions, we use them and predict quality
 parameter values for our test set and then we compare these predicted values
 against our polynomial fit values (from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Getting-Quality-data"

\end_inset

 ) and find out the 
\emph on
root mean square error(RMSE), 
\emph default
where we assume that the polynomial fit values are the true values.
 We use this 
\emph on

as a metric to compare between the solutions and pick the solution with
 minimum

\begin_layout Standard
Like explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Cycle-splitting"

\end_inset

, we split each detected cycle into equal sized sections before running
 our algorithms.
 Here we use a table to denote the performance characteristics of a table
 which would help us take a decision about how good/bad a method is.
 A table denotes to a method which splits a cycle into a fixed number of
 equal-sized segments and uses a particular method for polynomial variable
 generation.
 The first column shows the maximum degree used for polynomial variable
 formation.
 The second number shows the degree of freedom of the model which in our
 case is the number of variables with non-zero coefficients.
 The third and fourth columns show the 
\emph on
root mean square error (RMSE)
\emph default
 of the best solution available for that degree (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Parameter-comparison-andselection"

\end_inset

) for the test set and training set respectively.Finally, the last two columns
 denote the maximum error for of the best solution for both the test set
 and the training set respectively.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we are primarily concerned with the RMSE value of each solution.
 As we can see from the tables:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Usually, the orthonormal and mixed polynomials offer outputs usually have
 more or less similar values of RMSE.
 However, the time taken to implement the 'mixed polynomial variable' method
 increases much more rapidly than the 'orthonormal variables method' as
 we increase the degree and number of splits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For higher degree orthonormal variables' method, we may get high RMSE due
 to usually just ONE extremely high error value which indicates .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For most of the cases, the RMSE remains more or less the same as we change
 the degree keeping other factors constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Usually, as we increase the number of splits, the RMSE value keeps on dropping
 until we reach five sections where we see the RMSE shoot up after which
 the RMSE goes back down.
 Although this may seem to be an anomaly in the begining, there is a perfectly
 reasonable explanation for which becomes evident when we have a look at
 the way the splits are made.
 In all the splits, save for 5 splits, the significant spike which occurs
 in the range of 30-35 seconds is untouched and the entire feature falls
 into one section.
 However, this is not the case for 5 splits.
 The split midway the feature masks the contribution of the pattern as a
 whole.
 This is not surprising as the quality parameter we are measuring (Ra) would
 depend heavily on the finishing cut of the tool which takes place near
 the end of the cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Feedback Splitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Cycle-splitting"

\end_inset

, in this we first hypothesize a split and run our algorithm to obtain a
 solution.
 If this solution provides significant improvement, we retain the split
 and move on to make further splits.
 We have two ways to make these succesive splits.
 We could approach this splitting either from start of the cycle (
\series bold
Forward feedback splitting

) or the end of the cycle (
\series bold
Reverse feedback splitting
\series default
).
 Here we will show the various cases where we vary the direction of splitting,
 the threshold of relative difference of error and type of method used for
 variable creation (mixed polynomial or orthogonal polynomial).
 The results will be shown as two graphs where one will represent the splits
 in the cycle and the other the trend in the RMSE.
 We will also be showing the final RMSE value that we obtain using the method.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see from the results above, there isn't a lot of variation in
 the final RMSE value which we find using various combinations of split
 direction, threshold and variable type.
 They more or less fall around 
\begin_inset Formula $0.03\mu m$
\end_inset

.
 However, there are certain other aspects that interesting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Firstly, as mentioned before, when performing cuts from the start of the
 cycle, we tend to get more and closer cuts near the start and lesser towards
 the end and the the other way around when we start splitting from the end
 of the cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Another important thing that we notice is that we get lesser number of splits
 when we split from the end of the cycle.
 This indicates that we can get better correlation by sampling the end of
 the cycle.
 This inference as mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Discussion-uniform splitting"

\end_inset

 is not surprising as the finishing operation is done near the end of the
 cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As we can see in all the split figures, the significant pattern in 30-35
 seconds is considered as section in all of them.
 In fact, in reverse splits, better splitting in this region is the reason
 why we approach the minimum error region with lesser number of overall
 splits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Incremental calculation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we would expect while running the algorithm for manually drawn cuts (ref
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Cycle-splitting"

\end_inset

), the final RMSE values are more or less the same.
 However, we tried incremental sectionwise calculation here.
 In this, we first include only the first section as input and find a solution
 and store the resultant RMSE.
 Then we take the first two sections and find a solution ad store the RMSE.
 We keep on including subsequent sections and find the correspond RMSE's.
 This way we can try to find out the quality of a product before the part
 has been finished making.
 The future applications of such a capability are immense.
 Especially for parts which take a lot of time to be machined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The splits we used for this have been chosen manually as in Fig

\begin_layout Standard
As evident from all the previous examples, we don't find significant variation
 in the results after using either mixed polynomials or orthogonal polynomials
 as our variables.
 So here we only present the 
\emph on
mixed polynomial variable 
\emph default
scenario.
 Also, this scenario will help us in finding out which sections contribute
 more to the equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:RMSE-values-incremental"

\end_inset

 we show the RMSE values we get after using various number of sections from
 the splits as shown in Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Manual-Chosen-splits"

\end_inset

 for each degree of the polynomial variable (mixed polynomial variable).
 Interestingly we come very close to to the final RMSE value in the 7th
 section which ends about 13s before the end of our cycle (cycle time is
 33 sec).

Table

 shows a particular solutions' (Degree 5 polynomial with 10 sections) statistics.
 The middle column shows the list of coefficients in the equation we get.
 Columns 1 and 3 show the minimum and maximum value of the variables that
 we get using the test set for that corresponding variable.
 When we look at the coefficients we find that the 14th coefficient is the
 highest.
 Infact the order of magnitude of the product of fourteenth variable with
 it's corresponding coefficient is the highest too.
 Thus, clearly, these variables can be told to be the most important variables.
 If we denote this variable as 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{imp},$
\end_inset

 it turns out that this variable is given as;
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{imp}=sd(sec_{9})*sd(sec_{10})
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $sd()$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation function and 
\begin_inset Formula $sec_{x}$
\end_inset

 denotes section number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we again see that the end of the cycle is the region which gives us
 the most important information.
